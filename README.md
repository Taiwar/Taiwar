# Hi, I'm Jonas! 👋

I'm a software developer who is passionate about the entire process of creating all parts of a digital system -
From ideas and _requirements_ to _evaluation_ and _deployment_ 🖥️📄.

My main educational and professional background is in _cloud_, _web_ and _distributed systems_ which I'm always excited
to learn more about, but I've also enjoyed working on _geographical information systems_ and _data science_ problems.

## Current Technologies & Tools I like
🔣 **Languages**
- 🇹 _Typescript_ is great for writing maintainable code without compromising the versatility of JavaScript and is my go-to for anything web-related.
- 🐹 _Go_ helped me rethink how to engineer maintainable and performant cloud services
- 🐍 Unsurprisingly, no data analysis or ML project can do without _Python_ and its amazingly large ecosystem

🛠️ **Tools**
- 🐋 _Docker_ was my first and continues to be my most-used tool for creating reproducible environments (and compose is so convenient!)
- 🛞 _Kubernetes_ is an amazing tool for distributed systems that I have played with, but I'm working on becoming truly proficient with
- ⛰️ _Terraform_ is a perfect pairing with Kubernetes and replacing manual infrastructure management with code is a game-changer

## Education
- 🌐 **(WIP)** M. Sc. Software Engineering of Distributed Systems, KTH Royal Institute of Technology
- 👨‍💻 B. Sc. Media- and Communication Informatics, Reutlingen University
